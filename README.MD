This project analyzes 4 years of detailed household power consumption data to predict daily electricity usage using machine learning models in R. It was completed as part of the **DataCamp Real-World Projects** series.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Modern smart homes generate granular electricity consumption data. This project leverages that data to:

- Explore seasonal and weekly usage patterns
- Engineer time-based features for modeling
- Train and compare **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models
- Predict daily electricity usage for future time points

By improving consumption forecasting, such models can benefit energy providers and consumers alike through **load balancing**, **personalized recommendations**, and **grid efficiency**.

## 🧾 Dataset

The dataset consists of **train** and **test** sets:

- `df_train.csv`: Historical data used for training models  
- `df_test.csv`: Future data used to evaluate model predictions

## 🧠 Methodology

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Temporal patterns: average consumption by **year**, **month**, and **day of week**
- NA handling and categorical encoding (e.g., `day_in_week`)

### 🔨 Feature Engineering

- One-hot encoding using `model.matrix()`
- Creation of time-based predictors (e.g., semester, quarter)

### 🤖 Models Trained

- **Random Forest** (`ranger`)  
- **XGBoost** (`xgboost` with `reg:squarederror`)

Both models were trained on the same feature set and evaluated on the test set using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

---

## 📈 Results

| Model           | RMSE       |
|----------------|------------|
| Random Forest  | **391.50** |
| XGBoost        | 435.69     |

The Random Forest model outperformed XGBoost in predictive accuracy.

### ✅ Trend Matching

Both models captured **weekday-level patterns** in electricity usage, showing good alignment between observed and predicted daily trends.
